  - 'Hey, you

    aren''t you the new miner here?

    I have heard about your situation'
  - 'I am very sorry to hear all of it.

    At this moment we can''t help you'
  - 'But if you help with our mine we maybe can help you back. '
  - I give you permissions to enter our mine. You can earn some gold there
  - First you need to get some weapons. I suggest that you go to speak with our blacksmith
    Teppo and our village witch Mirjam. Maybe they have some weapons for free
